## Generate paper figures

this python script generates the figures depicted in our paper. Several
data science packages are required to run this script. We recommend
installing a data science distribution like `anaconda` which provides all
the prerequisites.

## Commands

You can generate the figures by issuing the following command,

```bash
[path-to-anaconda3]/anaconda3/bin/python3 generate-paper-figures.py
```
We tested this script with `anaconda` v2019.03 and `python` v3.7.3.
To check your `anaconda` version you can issue,

```bash
[path-to-anaconda3]/anaconda3/bin/conda list anaconda$
```
